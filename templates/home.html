            This is an online competition site for the UC Berkeley CS188 Intro to AI course's <a href="https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/pacman/contest.html">Capture the Flag Contest</a>, allowing teams and individuals to test their PacMan agents anonymously, without exposing their code.
        </p>
        <p>
            Please don't abuse this. The site in its current state is unstable, and overloading it with requests or excessive submissions helps no one.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Use this form to submit your own agent to compete against other teams' submissions. Please submit a .py file renamed to your team name. You can reupload your agent multiple times, as long as it has the same team name it will overwrite your previously uploaded version.
        </p>

            Use this form to request a match between two uploaded agents. The request will be put into a queue, and once the match is played out the logs and replays can be downloaded from the <a href="{{ url_for('results') }}">Results</a> page.
