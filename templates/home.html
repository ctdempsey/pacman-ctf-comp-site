        <br>
        <p>
            I've made a alternative online competition for the Unimelb COMP90054 Pacman Contest, since testing once a day is really not enough when you're constantly making changes and want to know how it stands against other teams' agents.
        </p>
        <p>
            Please don't abuse this. I slapped this together in a couple of hours and it will probably break even if it's just left to sit idle for the next 24 hours.
        </p>
        <p>
            (Bit late I know but, hey, it's something)

            Use this form to submit your own agent to compete against other teams. Please submit a .py file renamed to your team name. You can reupload your agent multiple times, as long as it has the same team name it will overwrite your previously uploaded version.
